Neuro-Resurrection Framework

A Speculative System for Post-Mortem Neural Preservation & Revival

Status: Conceptual / World-Building
Author: Madyson Mitchell
Project Codename: NRP-7 / FSH-12 / CSC-9 / NIES-5

Overview

This repository outlines a speculative end-to-end protocol for preserving a human nervous system after biological death, maintaining structural and electrochemical integrity during long-term stasis, and reinstalling it into a genetically matched somatic clone.

The framework is intentionally impossible with current technology. It exists as a fictional research system, suitable for world-building, storytelling, or speculative bioengineering concepts.

Sections

I. Neuro-Resurrection PolyGel (NRP-7)

A self-healing cryo-polymer gel designed to stabilize the entire nervous system post-mortem. Prevents synaptic collapse, oxidative damage, and microstructural deformation.

II. Full-System Harvest & Neural Continuity Protocol (FSH-12)

An extraction process for removing the entire neuro-axis—brain, spinal cord, roots, sensory organs—while preserving identity-critical architecture.

III. Clonal Somatic Chassis Generation (CSC-9)

A protocol for growing an immunologically perfect body clone with pre-aligned neural docking pathways. Maintains biological function while remaining identity-empty.

IV. Neural Integration & Electrical Reanimation Sequence (NIES-5)

The staged reinstallation and activation process, using controlled electrical pulses and polymer-gel environments to reboot the preserved nervous system into its new chassis.

Features

- distributed-consciousness preservation
- self-healing cryo-gel biomaterials
- whole-nervous-system extraction
- identity-aligned clone generation
- controlled reanimation sequences
- fictional failure-mode analysis
- research-lab horror undertones (optional but recommended)

---

Purpose

This project is a fictional exploration of:

- neural continuity
- identity architecture
- speculative bioengineering
- consciousness preservation
- synthetic resurrection frameworks

It is not intended as a real biological protocol. It is a narrative and conceptual scaffold.
